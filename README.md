# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ruan

I'm a backend developer and Python enthusiast, currently studying **Analysis and Systems Development**. I specialize in building automations and backend solutions using Python, Django, and a variety of powerful libraries.

## What I'm Learning

- Python (from basics to advanced)
- Backend development and clean architecture
- Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with tools like `pywinauto`, `n8n`, and `BotCity`
- Web frameworks such as `Django` for creating robust web applications
- Writing clean, maintainable code with `PEP8`, `flake8`, and `black`
- Getting started with Machine Learning and Data Science

## I Teach Python!

I also teach Python programming, helping others understand both basic and advanced concepts, from syntax and logic to automation and best practices in software development.

## Goals for 2025

- Continue improving in backend development and software design
- Master automation with Python in real-world environments
- Expand my skills in data-driven applications and ML
- Share knowledge through tutorials, classes, and open collaboration

## Let's connect!

I'm always open to learning, teaching, and building something meaningful. Check out my GitHub, and feel free to reach out for collaboration or tech discussions!
